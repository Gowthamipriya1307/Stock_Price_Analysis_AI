# AI Crew for Stock Analysis ðŸ§ ðŸ“Š

## Introduction

This is a GenAI-based project that automates end-to-end stock research and investment analysis using the CrewAI framework. I designed this multi-agent system to simulate how financial analysts, researchers, and advisors collaborate to analyze a company and generate insights.

Built as a learning project for exploring Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), agent collaboration, and financial data tools â€” integrating LLMs like GPT-4 or local models like Ollama.

## CrewAI Framework

CrewAI is a multi-agent framework where role-based LLM agents coordinate with each other to complete a complex task. In this use case, I've configured agents like:

- **Financial Analyst** â†’ Reviews 10-K, 10-Q filings
- **Market Researcher** â†’ Scrapes real-time insights
- **Investment Advisor** â†’ Recommends action

They interact to produce a summary stock report.
